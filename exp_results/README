======== Files ========

env-dqn.txt: DQN experiment result. 20 epoch, ~11 hours, ~30 min/epoch, 5000000 step/epoch

env-a3c.txt: A3C (vanilla) experiment result. 30~45 epoch, 12~15 hours, ~18 min/epoch, 6000 step/epoch

env-a3c.txt-double-shared: Double A3C (share paras of the first 3 conv layers; different paras for 1 convolutional, 1 fully connected, 1 output layer, using concat + fully connected to get policy) experiment result: 30~45 epoch. 12~15 hours, ~20 min/epoch, 6000 step/epoch

env-ac3-double-no-shared: Double A3C (no shared NN)


======== Experiment Details ========

IceHockey-a3c.txt-double-shared is still runnning. The results will be ready by next morning.

We can use mean score as performance. When comparing A3C algorithms, we can use epochs or steps as x-axis. When comparing A3C's to DQN, we can use runtime as x-axis. Performance details can be found in each file.

Runtime details can be found in each file. Different experiments have different number of epochs and runtime. Feel free to truncate the experiment if needed. But I think it's ok to have curves with different lengths (different number of epochs/runtime) on the same plot when comparing.

I have not drawn the plots yet. Feel free to use plotting codes in "my_plot.py".
